# UEDX46460015-MD50ESP32-1.5inch-Touch-Knob-Display

Simple example of configured UEDX46460015-MD50ESP32-1.5inch-Touch-Knob-Display with **Arduino GFX Library** and LVGL

Currently animations are broken, I don't know why but it is not rendering correctly

Bus is `QSPI` and display driver is `CO5300`
